Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Musical Instrument Reviews

This project involves performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews of musical instruments from Amazon. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine sentiment or subjective information within text data.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze and understand the sentiments expressed by customers in their reviews of various musical instruments available on Amazon. By leveraging machine learning and text analysis techniques, this project aims to classify and understand sentiments expressed in these reviews.

Methodology
Data Collection: Amazon reviews on musical instruments were collected using web scraping techniques.
Data Preprocessing: The collected text data was preprocessed, including text cleaning, tokenization, and transforming the reviews into a format suitable for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing machine learning algorithms and NLP libraries, sentiment analysis was performed to determine the sentiment polarity of the reviews (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
Visualization and Insights: The sentiment results were visualized to gain insights into customer sentiments about different musical instruments.
Technologies Used
Python
Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (NLTK, SpaCy)
